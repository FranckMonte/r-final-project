Coronary heart disease is a type of heart disease that develops when the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. __It is the leading cause of death in the United States__.\n\n(Emphasis by me. Source: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/espanol/enfermedad-coronaria)\n\nAlso, according to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases are the __leading cause of death globally__ (source:  https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)). \n\nIn this notebook we try to learn enough information of this topic to understand the [Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) dataset and build simple models to predict whether a patient has a disease or not based on features like the heart rate during exercise or the cholesterol levels in the blood.\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library(corrplot)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.229489Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.231209Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.245727Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Read the data\ndata <- read.csv('../input/heart-disease/heart.csv')\n\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.249495Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.251483Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.277644Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library('caTools')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.280222Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.281704Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.295058Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"head(data)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.297573Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.299032Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.327430Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# DISPLAY THE NUMBER OF ROWS AND COLUMNS\nnrow(data)\nncol(data)\nstr(data)\nsummary(data)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.329882Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.331255Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.376526Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Deleting not related variables\ndata = subset(data, select = c(-thal,-ca))\n# Converting the categorical data to R factors\ndata$sex <- as.factor(data$sex)\ndata$target <- as.factor(data$target)\ndata$cp <- as.factor(data$cp)\ndata$exang <- as.factor(data$exang)\ndata$slope <- as.factor(data$slope)\ndata$fbs <- as.factor(data$fbs)\ndata$restecg <- as.factor(data$restecg)\ndata$exang <- as.factor(data$exang)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.378959Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.380351Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.408720Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"summary(data)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.411076Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.412473Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.438897Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To have a better views of what we are going to do, we will divide the value \"age\" into three goups.\nOne group will be the Young_age (<45)\nthe second will be the middle_age (45-55)\nFinally the Old_age (>55)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Group the different ages in three groups (young, middle, old)\nYoung <- data[which((data$age<45)), ]\nMiddle <- data[which((data$age>=45)&(data$age<55)), ]\nOld <- data[which(data$age>55), ]\ngroups <- data.frame(age_group = c(\"Young\",\"Middle\",\"Old\"), group_count = c(NROW(Young$age), NROW(Middle$age), NROW(Old$age)))\n\n#ploting different age groups\nggplot(groups, aes(x=age_group, y=group_count, fill=age_group)) + \n  ggtitle(\"Age Analysis\") +\n  xlab(\"Age Group\")  +\n  ylab(\"group Count\") +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Age Group\", labels = c(\"Middle\", \"Old\", \"Young\"))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.441227Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.442564Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-17T22:55:18.730334Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we can see on the graph above above a population of old people are the one who are more flexible to get or not heart disease.
